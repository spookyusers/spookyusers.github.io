        <h2>Selected Projects</h2>

        <h3>Michelson interferometer measurements</h3>
        <p>
          Built, aligned, and operated a Michelson interferometer to perform precision optical measurements.
          Used controlled mirror translation and fringe frequency analysis to measure the wavelength of a He-Ne laser,
          and quantified changes in refractive index of air under varying pressure using a gas cell.
          Additional measurements included determining the refractive index of a quartz slab via slab rotation.
          The work involved photodiode and oscilloscope data acquisition, fringe counting, uncertainty propagation,
          and analysis of systematic experimental limitations.

        <h3>Zeeman Effect in Mercury and Neon Spectra</h3>
        <p>
          Measured magnetic field induced splitting of atomic emission lines in mercury and neon using a high-resolution
          Czerny-Turner grating spectrometer. Resolved both normal and anomalous Zeeman patterns and extracted effective
          Lande g-factors from Gaussian fits to split spectral lines.
          Achieved agreement with theory at the 1-5$ level, including geff ~2.0 for the normal Zeeman triplet and
          reduced g-factors for anomalous transitions. Verified linear dependence of wavelength splitting on magnetic
          field strength and used neon data to experimentally determine the electron charge-to-mass ratio.

        <h3>Faraday Rotation and Verdet Constant Measurement</h3>
        <p>
          Observed magneto-optical Faraday rotation in multiple glass samples under longitudinal magnetic fields.
          Established Malus's Law baselines for polarized light transmission and measured rotation angles as a function
          of applied field strength.
          Extracted Verdet constants for three materials at red, yellow, and blue wavelengths, confirming linear Faraday
          rotation (ϕ = V B d) and the expected increase in magnitude at shorter wavelengths. Data acquisition and 
          analysis were performed using photodiode measurements and Python nonlinear fitting and regression.

        <h3>433 MHz Band Sensor Decoding with RTL-SDR</h3>
        <p>
          Used software-defined radio (RTL-SDR dongle) and rtl_433 to passively receive and decode 433.92 MHz transmissions
          from consumer wireless devices in the local area.
          Successfully captured and identified signals from multiple indoor/outdoor temperature/humidity sensors, soil
          moisture/temperature probes, and a DSC wireless security door/window contact.
          Built rtl_433 from source on Linux, tuned a dipole antenna, documented setup, raw captures, and analysis.

        <h3>Automated Two-Slit Interference Scanning</h3>
        <p>
          Designed and built an automated scanning system for Young's double-slit experiment using a motorized spinning mirror, photodiode, 
          and oscilloscope. Spinning mirror reflects laser across a photodiode sensor to display the intensity of the overall interference
          pattern on the oscilloscope.
