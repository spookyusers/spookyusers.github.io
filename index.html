        <h3>Michelson interferometer measurements</h3>
        <p>
          Built, aligned, and operated a Michelson interferometer to perform precision optical measurements.
          Used controlled mirror translation and fringe frequency analysis to measure the wavelength of a He-Ne laser,
          and quantified changes in refractive index of air under varying pressure using a gas cell.
          Additional measurements included determining the refractive index of a quartz slab via slab rotation.
          The work involved photodiode and oscilloscope data acquisition, fringe counting, uncertainty propagation,
          and analysis of systematic experimental limitations.
