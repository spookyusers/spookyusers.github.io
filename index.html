        <h3>Experimental Physics</h3>

        <h4>Michelson interferometer measurements</h4>
        <p>
          Built, aligned and operated a Michelson interferometer for precision optical measurements.
          Measured the wavelength of a He-Ne laser and the refractive index of air under varying pressure
          via fringe analysis, and determined the refractive index of a quartz slab using slab rotation, 
          with photodiode and oscilloscope based data acquisition and uncertainty analysis.

        </p>

        <h4>Zeeman Effect in Mercury and Neon Spectra</h4>
        <p>
          Measured magnetic field induced splitting of atomic emission lines in mercury and neon using a high 
          resolution Czerny-Turner grating spectrometer. Resolved both normal and anomolous Zeeman patterns, 
          extracted effective Lande g-factors from Gaussian fits to split spectral lines, verified linear 
          splitting with magnetic field, and used neon data to experimentally determine the electron charge 
          to mass ratio, achieving agreement with theory at the 1-5% level.

        <h4>Faraday Rotation and Verdet Constant Measurement</h4>
        <p>
          Measured magneto-optical Faraday rotation in multiple glass samples and extracted wavelength 
          dependent Verdet constants using photodiode measurements and Python based fitting, confirming linear 
          Faraday rotation.

        <h3>Independent / Technical Projects</h3>

        <h4>433 MHz Band Sensor Decoding with RTL-SDR</h4>
        <p>
          Used a software-defined radio (RTL-SDR) and rtl_433 to passively receive and decode 433.92 MHz transmissions
          from consumer wireless devices. Captured and identified signals from environmental sensors and a 
          wireless security contact, building rtl_433 from source on Linux, tuning a dipole antenna, and 
          documenting raw captures and analysis.

        </p>

        <h4>Automated Two-Slit Interference Scanning</h4>
        <p>
          Designed and built an automated scanning system for Young's double-slit experiment using a motorized spinning mirror, photodiode, 
          and oscilloscope. The rotating mirror swept the inteference pattern across a fixed detector, enabling a real-time visualization 
          of fringe intensity on the oscilloscope.
